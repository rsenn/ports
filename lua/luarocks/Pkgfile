# Description: A deployment system for Lua modules.
#  LuaRocks is a deployment and management system for modules in the Lua
#  programming language. It aims to provide facilities for Lua such as
#  those from module systems of other scripting languages, such as Ruby's
#  RubyGems or Perl's CPAN. LuaRocks allows Lua modules to be installed
#  as self-contained packages called "rocks", which also contain version
#  and dependency information. This information is used at install time
#  so that when one rock is requested, all rocks it depends on are also
#  installed. It's also used at run time so that when a module is required,
#  the correct version is loaded.
